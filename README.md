## ✅ Task Objective

The goal of **Task-02** was to analyze the Titanic dataset using **Python** by performing **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand what factors influenced passenger survival.

---

## 🔍 What I Did

- Loaded the Titanic dataset from Google Drive using Pandas  
- Cleaned missing values in `age`, `embarked`, and `cabin` columns  
- Created new features like `age_group`, `fare_group`, and `family_size`  
- Visualized survival rates by **gender**, **passenger class**, and **age group**  
- Generated a combined EDA output image with pie chart and bar graphs

---

## 💡 Key Learnings

- How to clean and preprocess real-world data using Pandas  
- Handling missing values with group-wise median and mode  
- Feature engineering for deeper insights  
- Creating multi-plot visual summaries using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 📸 Visualization Summary

The image above includes:
- 🔘 A pie chart showing overall survival rate (38.4%)  
- 👩‍👩‍👧‍👦 Bar plots comparing survival by gender (females had higher rates)  
- 🛳️ Survival by class (1st class had highest survival)  
- 👶 Survival trends across age groups (children had better chances)
